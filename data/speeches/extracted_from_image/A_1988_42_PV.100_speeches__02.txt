The SECRETARY-GENERAL (interpretation from Spanish):
It is with deep sadness that I reiterate to the Government and the people of Nicaragua the condolences of the United Nations and my own very sincere condolences on the untimely demise of Ambassador Nora Astorga Gadea, Permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the United Nations. 
We have all witnessed her courage in the face of physical illness and the calm strength of her convictions, as well as her valuable contribution to the activities of the Organization. We shall long cherish her memory. 
As Secretary-General it is with deep emotion that I associate myself with this tribute to her memory.
