The SECRETARY-GENERAL (interpretation from Spanish):
In this Hall where representatives of the world community come together in the search for harmonious formulas of coexistence. I wish to pay sincere tribute to the memory of Dr. José Luis Bustamante y Rivero, recently departed, who, as a distinguished member of the International Court of Justice and President of the Court, as well as former President of Peru and an experienced diplomat, leaves behind a memorable example in support of those noble objectives. The activities of Dr. Bustamante, of whom, as a Peruvian citizen, I am proud, extended beyond national boundaries. In his capacity as a jurist and as President of the International Court of Justice, a main organ of the United Nations, he did outstanding work based on international law as a basic tool in relations among States. The same ideas inspired his mediation in the difference that arose between El Salvador and Honduras, which led to a successful solution.
Throughout a long and fruitful public career, going from President of Peru to President of the International Court of Justice, Dr. Bustamante placed at the service of the international community his qualities of personal honesty and intellectual sincerity and was guided by all the principles of justice and fairness which inspire the work of our Organization.
