The SECRETARY-GENERAL:
Mr. President, the dispatch with which the General Assembly under your distinguished leadership has dealt with our urgent task of making financial arrangements for the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) has indeed been impressive. It has swiftly complemented Security Council resolution 619 (1988) and has created a sound basis for the functioning of UNIIMOG.
With this step by the General Assembly the process we have initiated for lasting peace between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq will be further strengthened.
