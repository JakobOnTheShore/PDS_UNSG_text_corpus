Ata moment when the world is more sharply and\\ndangerously divided than at any time since the United\\nNations was founded, I have been greatly impressed by\\nthe strong support for the principles of the Charter and\\nthe faith in the United Nations approach to the problem\\nof peace that have been expressed by so many speakers\\nin the general debate.\\n37. It must be admitted, of course, that the basic\\ndifferences between the two sides in the world conflict\\nhave not been diminished by a few days of general\\nebate,\\n38. At the same time I do not recall at any previous\\nsession such a demonstration as we have had here in\\nthe opening days of purpose on the part of governments\\n- to make the United Nations work effectively for peace.\\nMany concrete proposals to this end have been made.\\nThey will receive, I am sure, the consideration they\\nmerit frora the committees that examine them.\\n39. My own views as Secretary-General on the great\\nissues before this session of the General Assembly have\\nbeen placed on record in.several reports and statements\\nduring the past few months.\\n40.

Ata moment when the world is more sharply and\\ndangerously divided than at any time since the United\\nNations was founded, I have been greatly impressed by\\nthe strong support for the principles of the Charter and\\nthe faith in the United Nations approach to the problem\\nof peace that have been expressed by so many speakers\\nin the general debate.\\n37. It must be admitted, of course, that the basic\\ndifferences between the two sides in the world conflict\\nhave not been diminished by a few days of general\\nebate,\\n38. At the same time I do not recall at any previous\\nsession such a demonstration as we have had here in\\nthe opening days of purpose on the part of governments\\n- to make the United Nations work effectively for peace.\\nMany concrete proposals to this end have been made.\\nThey will receive, I am sure, the consideration they\\nmerit frora the committees that examine them.\\n39. My own views as Secretary-General on the great\\nissues before this session of the General Assembly have\\nbeen placed on record in.several reports and statements\\nduring the past few months.\\n40. I refer to my fifth annual report * to the Members on the work of the Organization and my memo-\\n. rvandum of points for consideration in the development\\nof a twenty-year programme for achieving peace\\nthrough the United Nations [4/1304] ; to my statement\\nto the Security Council on 25 June last, concerning the\\nKorean conflict, when for the first time I invoked\\nArticle 99 of the Charter; and to additional statements\\nof my position on some of the issues before you in\\npublic addresses at Oslo and Chicago.\\n41. I shall not take the time of the representatives to\\nrepeat these views today, although I wish to discuss\\nsome of them further at a later stage, in particular\\nwhen the time comes for the Assembly to consicer the\\ndevelopment of a twenty-year peace programme.\\n42. I wish now only to place before you the following\\nthree articles of faith as a short resume of the whole\\nebate:\\n43. First, the United Nations must and can demonstrate its capacity to deal effectively with armed aggression now and in the future. .\\n44. Secondly, through the United Nations it is still\\npossible gradually to reduce the present tensions and, by\\npatient work, to move towards a reconciliation of the\\nconflicting interests so manifest in the world today.\\n45.
