      "I repeat: $3.2 billion.\n",
      "In my letter of 21 July of this year to the former\n",
      "President of the General Assembly, I drew attention to the\n",
      "grave situation we face in cash accounts of peace-keeping\n",
      "operations. I outlined a number of emergency measures.\n",
      "While a number of Member States responded positively, the\n",
      "problems continue. Therefore, I once again draw the\n",
      "attention of the General Assembly to this serious situation.\n",
      "Together, we must restore a viable financial basis in order\n",
      "20 to enable the Organization to continue its work in the\n",
      "service of the Member States.\n",
      "The causes of our precarious financial situation are\n",
      "clear.\n",
      "The first cause is late payments by Member States\n",
      "of assessed contributions, for both the regular budget and\n",
      "for peace-keeping operations. While some Member States\n",
      "pay their assessments on time, many others do not. By\n",
      "the end of August, only 56 Member States had paid their\n",
      "regular budget assessment in full, while 70 Member\n",
      "States had made no payment towards their 1994 regular\n",
      "budget assessment. By the end of September, 62 Member\n",
      "States still had made no payment.\n",
      "The second cause lies in the process of approving\n",
      "peace-keeping budgets and appropriations. Months go by\n",
      "between the date when the Security Council approves a\n",
      "peace-keeping mission and the date when cash to pay for\n",
      "it is first received. Following Security Council approval,\n",
      "detailed budgets for the missions have to be prepared and\n",
      "approved before the required amounts can be assessed.\n",
      "Obviously, more time passes before the assessed\n",
      "contributions are actually paid.\n",
      "In other words, lateness and delay create an\n",
      "imbalance in the cash position of the Organization. The\n",
      "inflow of cash is far less than the Organization needs to\n",
      "meet its obligations. Because of these late and delayed\n",
      "payments, the Organization has had to delay, in turn, its\n",
      "own payments to Member States. In effect, the Member\n",
      "States which wait for payment from the United Nations\n",
      "are financing the late payment by other Member States.\n",
      "This is not a satisfactory state of affairs.\n",
      "I am pleased to confirm that in recent weeks a\n",
      "number of Member States have made substantial\n",
      "payments. This has ameliorated the situation. Some\n",
      "payments to troop- and equipment-contributing Member\n",
      "States have been made possible. But amelioration is not\n",
      "a solution. Cash inflow from Member States has been\n",
      "followed by cash outflow to reimburse Member States.\n",
      "Thus, the situation was eased temporarily but not\n",
      "resolved. The Organization’s liabilities still far exceed its\n",
      "available cash, and therefore the financial situation\n",
      "continues to be precarious.\n",
      "The problem is not only the Member States’ late or\n",
      "delayed payments; there is a more fundamental problem.\n",
      "The Organization has extremely limited cash reserves.\n",
      "The Working Capital Fund, less than one month’s\n",
      "requirement of the regular budget, is today virtually\n",
      "depleted. And at present, there is practically no cash in the\n",
      "peace-keeping reserve fund.\n",
      "The Organization simply cannot operate effectively\n",
      "under these constraints. We must have a secure capital\n",
      "base with attendant cash reserves. Therefore I ask\n",
      "Members to consider not only the problems caused by late\n",
      "and delayed payments but also the fundamental problem of\n",
      "insufficient reserves. I ask that Members urgently consider\n",
      "these issues.\n",
      "There is another important element in the\n",
      "Organization’s financial structure: the method of\n",
      "assessment. Over the years, Member States have endorsed\n",
      "three basic concepts regarding the Organization’s expenses.\n",
      "One concept is \"capacity to pay\". Member States with\n",
      "greater per capita resources and ability to pay should bear\n",
      "a greater share of the costs. A second concept - for\n",
      "peace-keeping expenses - is that the permanent members of\n",
      "the Security Council bear a special responsibility and that\n",
      "those with greater resources should bear a greater share of\n",
      "the cost. And the third concept is that realignment of\n",
      "Member States’ contributions should be based on objective\n",
      "measures.\n",
      "Member States may wish to review the practical\n",
      "application of these concepts in the sharing of the\n",
      "Organization’s expenses. Each Member State should\n",
      "seriously consider whether the present scale of assessments\n",
      "is equitable. Some have expressed strong doubts. From\n",
      "this review, adjustments to the existing arrangements could\n",
      "emerge. It is important that Member States view the\n",
      "arrangements for sharing the Organization’s expenses as\n",
      "fair.\n",
      "In my report on the work of the Organization\n",
      "(A/49/1), I stressed the urgent need to overcome the critical\n",
      "financial situation of the United Nations. The problem has\n",
      "assumed a proportion which undermines the effectiveness\n",
      "of the Organization as a whole. The ability of the United\n",
      "Nations to perform the functions for which it was created\n",
      "is in danger.\n",
      "This is no longer simply a financial question; it is an\n",
      "urgent political question.\n",
      "The ideas which I have described are outlined in\n",
      "greater detail in a document being distributed to delegations\n",
      "as I speak. I offer them as a contribution to the solution of\n",

      "treaties.\n",

      "non-proliferation regimes must be coupled with the transfer\n",
      "of technology for peaceful and legitimate purposes. The\n",
      "Missile Technology Control Regime, for example, should be\n",
      "developed into a cooperative instrument. It should make\n",
      "possible the transfer of advanced technology for peaceful\n",
      "purposes. This suggestion has been made before, but real\n",
      "progress in this direction is yet to be forthcoming.\n",
      "The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is\n",

      "undertaken through the Conference on Disarmament. I refer\n",
      "specifically here to the transfer of technology with military\n",

      "population has experienced runaway growth in recent years.\n",
      "From 1950 to 1990, it more than doubled in size.\n",
      "Currently, the world’s population exceeds 5.5 billion,\n",

      "increases in the developing countries.\n",
      "The international community has long understood that\n",
      "this trend presents a threat to stability. Thus, in 1947 - just\n",
      "two years after the United Nations came into being - the\n",
      "Population Commission was established. It was to track the\n",
      "growth of populations and provide other demographic\n",
      "information.\n",
      "The UNFPA became operational in 1969 - three years\n",
      "after the General Assembly authorized the United Nations\n",
      "to provide technical assistance relating to population.\n",
      "Supported through voluntary contributions, the Fund\n",
      "is now the largest internationally funded provider of\n",
      "population assistance to developing countries. Last year it\n",
      "approved 480 projects, for a total cost of $72 million.\n",
      "The Fund’s purpose is to help set up population\n",
      "planning programmes around the globe, and to provide\n",
      "financial assistance for their implementation. But it\n",
      "recognizes the broad social implications of its work. The\n",
      "Fund engages in other activities to further the\n",
      "implementation of population policies. These include work\n",
      "on census and civil registration; research in many fields;\n",
      "and information, communication and education. Particularly under the leadership of its current\n",
      "executive director, Mrs. Nafis Sadik, the UNFPA has\n",
      "focused on the empowerment of women. In so doing,\n",
      "Mrs. Sadik has made a major contribution to the cause of\n",
      "women’s rights.\n",
      "In its work the Fund has been careful to respect the\n",
      "sovereign right of self-determination, for this is the\n",
      "reflection of the individual right of choice at an\n",
      "international level.\n",
      "Over the past 25 years, the Fund has benefited from\n",
      "exceptional leadership - first, by the late Mr. Rafael Salas,\n",
      "and, since 1987, by Mrs. Sadik. I wish to pay tribute to\n",
      "them and to their staff. They have provided excellent\n",
      "service to the United Nations.\n",
      "The international community must continue to\n",
      "support the UNFPA. The Fund is uniquely situated to\n",
      "promote population policies. It brings to its work\n",
      "undoubted dedication, great moral weight, long practical\n",
      "and political experience, and presence in the field.\n",
      "The UNFPA has also helped to organize a series of\n",
      "global population conferences. They have provided\n",
      "essential help to the United Nations in its efforts to\n",
      "encourage global policies on population. These meetings\n",
      "have provided a forum for the world to take stock of\n",
      "potential problems and to map out solutions.\n",
      "At the 1974 World Population Conference, held in\n",
      "Bucharest, the international community adopted a World\n",
      "Plan of Action. It recognized the link between population\n",
      "and economic and social development. Ten years later\n",
      "the United Nations convened the International Conference\n",
      "on Population in Mexico City. The Declaration adopted\n",
      "there addressed such issues as migration, urbanization and\n",
      "ageing populations.\n",
      "Most recently the UNFPA played a major role in\n",
      "organizing the International Conference on Population and\n",
      "Development, held this September in Cairo. Mrs. Sadik\n",
      "was Secretary-General of the Conference. Almost 180\n",
      "countries joined with non-governmental organizations at\n",
      "the Conference to discuss how to balance population\n",
      "growth and sustainable development. And in six days the\n",
      "representatives of many disparate cultures succeeded in\n",
      "adopting a Programme of Action, which maps out a\n",
      "strategy for the next 20 years.\n",
      "Afterwards, Mrs. Sadik said that the Programme of\n",
      "Action adopted in Cairo \"starts from the reality of the\n",
      "3\n",
      "world we live in, and shows us the path to a better reality.\"\n",
      "Through specific goals, spanning issues from education to\n",
      "reproductive health to family planning, the international\n",
      "community charted a path that could lead the world away\n",
      "from environmental and social disasters.\n",
      "Such conferences have promoted awareness. But it is\n",
      "important to remember that the international community\n",
      "must follow through on the commitments it has made if it\n",
      "is to reap the benefits of its deliberations. Only political\n",
      "will, backed by financial resources, can give life to them.\n",
      "Otherwise, plans of action soon become meaningless.\n",
      "That is why the UNFPA’s role will continue to be\n",
      "important, and to be challenging. The Fund must continue\n",
      "to encourage societies to develop population policies. And\n",
      "it must continue to respect the traditions of many diverse\n",
      "societies for its work to touch on the most important\n",
      "questions for humanity - relating to the relationships\n",
      "between men and women, the question of families, and\n",
      "posterity.\n",

      "where the world can debate its future. Fundamental\n",
      "questions will be asked here. They may arouse concern.\n",
      "The UNFPA must be prepared for controversy. But this is\n",
      "a necessary part of its task, and indeed a testament to its\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "It is vital that in this enterprise we have the help of\n",
      "able and active programmes such as the UNFPA. I thank\n",

      "generated by administrative efficiencies towards investments\n",
      "that benefit developing countries.\n",
      "We are recommending ways to ensure more\n",

      "my proposal that the United Nations shift to results-based\n",

      "The Cairo Conference —\n",
      "the International Conference on Population and\n",
      "Development — whose fifth anniversary we are marking\n",
      "today, was not an isolated event. It was an integral part of\n",
      "the series of great conferences held by the United Nations\n",
      "during the 1990s. I am sure I do not need to remind the\n",
      "Assembly of the themes of those conferences: the global\n",
      "environment, human rights, population, social\n",
      "development, women, and human settlements. Those were\n",
      "distinct topics, but they were all related to each other and\n",
      "to one central, overarching aim: development —\n",
      "development of nations, and development of people.\n",
      "And all those conferences aimed to reach that goal\n",
      "through an organized, yet voluntary effort: a collective\n",
      "effort on a global scale; an effort by sovereign States and\n",
      "civil society working together; an effort guided by a\n",
      "common approach based on universal values and\n",
      "principles which we all could accept.\n",
      "So Cairo was not just a population conference. It\n",
      "was a conference on population and development. It was\n",
      "part of a process, going back 25 years or more, during\n",
      "which we have all learned that every society's hopes of\n",
      "social and economic development are intimately linked to\n",
      "demography. All States now understand that if they are to\n",
      "provide adequately for the future health and education of\n",
      "their citizens, they need to incorporate population policies\n",
      "into their development strategy.\n",
      "Abundant research has shown us that economic\n",
      "growth and development have profound effects on\n",
      "fertility, on the size of families, on the age pyramid, and\n",
      "on patterns of migration. And we hardly need research to\n",
      "tell us that living conditions at the local level — the\n",
      "family and the village — are reflected in the national\n",
      "standard of living. In other words, demography and\n",
      "development are constantly interacting. It seems\n",
      "blindingly obvious now, but until Cairo the world did not\n",
      "fully understand it.\n",
      "Since Cairo, the world does understand it; and it\n",
      "understands, too, that we have to stabilize the population\n",
      "of this planet. Quite simply, there is a limit to the\n",
      "pressures our global environment can stand. Patterns of\n",
      "consumption are one form of pressure, but another is the\n",
      "sheer size of the world's population, and a third is the\n",
      "way it is distributed around the globe.\n",
      "That is the global dimension. But there is also an\n",
      "individual dimension. Every human being aspires to\n",
      "health, security and dignity. That is the essence of human\n",
      "rights. And we now realize that sexual and reproductive\n",
      "health is an essential part of those rights.\n",
      "Do not we all recognize as universal the anguish of\n",
      "the individual who loses a wife or mother in childbirth\n",
      "because proper care is not available; of the teenager whose\n",
      "options in life are suddenly foreclosed, because she gets\n",
      "pregnant and drops out of school; of the woman who has to\n",
      "go on having children, even though she knows her health\n",
      "is at risk; or of the refugee who has been raped but is too\n",
      "frightened, or too ashamed, to ask for help?\n",
      "Better understanding of these issues has brought real\n",
      "change in the daily life of millions of people. They now\n",
      "have wider choices, and can make key decisions about their\n",
      "own lives. Let me give some examples of how things have\n",
      "changed since the first Population Conference, 25 years\n",
      "ago. Then, women in developing countries had an average\n",
      "of five children each; today they have fewer than three.\n",
      "Then, 30 per cent of couples used family planning; today,\n",
      "60 per cent do so — and the vast majority of Governments\n",
      "now support it. Then, 140 out of every 1,000 babies born\n",
      "alive would die during childhood; now, only 80 will. Then,\n",
      "average life expectancy was 59 years; now, it is 66. And in\n",
      "many countries, fewer women now die in childbirth,\n",
      "although reliable statistics on this are hard to come by and\n",
      "it is certainly an area where much needs to be done.\n",
      "Meanwhile, at the global level, the rate of growth of\n",
      "the world's population has slowed dramatically, from 2 per\n",
      "cent to 1.3 per cent per year. In another 25 years it should\n",
      "be down to 0.8 per cent.\n",
      "We are still adding 78 million to our numbers every\n",
      "year, but that figure, too, should decline, at first slowly and\n",
      "then, in the second decade of the century, quite steeply.\n",
      "All that is good news, for which every nation in the\n",
      "world can take some credit. States have acted on\n",
      "internationally agreed principles and on their own national\n",
      "priorities and values. Most of them have achieved slower,\n",
      "more balanced population growth, not by coercion but by\n",
      "enhancing individual freedom.\n",
      "We can all be proud that this has been achieved with\n",
      "the help of international consensus and cooperation under\n",
      "United Nations auspices. We should also acknowledge that\n",
      "it was not done by States alone. Non-governmental\n",
      "organizations and other parts of civil society made a big\n",
      "contribution. They spread the word. They lobbied for policy\n",
      "changes. They mobilized people to support national\n",
      "initiatives. So have we done all that the Cairo Conference\n",
      "recommended? No, my friends, there is still much to do.\n",
      "In too many countries, girls still do not have the same\n",
      "chance to be educated as boys. Too many women still\n",
      "cannot choose when or whether to become pregnant. Too\n",
      "many women are victims of sexual violence, especially\n",
      "during conflict. Too many women resort to abortions that\n",
      "are not safe. Too many are still subjected to genital\n",
      "mutilation and other harmful traditional practices. Too\n",

      "communist countries, in some of which life expectancy\n",
      "has actually declined — and so on.\n",
      "The stakes could hardly be higher. If only we could\n",
      "implement the Cairo Programme in full, we could make\n",
      "a tremendous difference to human rights, to hopes of\n",
      "prosperity and to the sustainable use of natural resources.\n",
      "We must do it. But we cannot do it without funds.\n",
      "In Cairo, everyone agreed on the need to mobilize new\n",
      "financial resources, from within developing countries and\n",
      "also from the international community. Since then,\n",
      "developing countries have proved their commitment. But\n",
      "they are cruelly limited in what they can achieve without\n",
      "outside help. Too often — let us admit it — they are also\n",
      "limited by the effects of conflicts, arms spending or\n",
      "inadequate leadership.\n",
      "But too often, also, they have to give priority to debt\n",

      "to prevent the recurrence of conflict.\n",
      "If there is one area, however, that has witnessed a\n",

      "is the effect of HIV/AIDS on every aspect of the\n",
      "continent’s prospects. Of the 25 countries most affected by\n",

      "then deny the United Nations the resources to give tangible\n",

      "First, the General Assembly should establish its own\n",
      "working group, comprising a cross-section of African States\n",
      "and other Member States engaged in Africa’s future. The\n",
      "Secretariat stands prepared to provide substantive support\n",

      "stock of the progress made so far in the implementation of\n",
      "the report’s proposals, and could consolidate and ensure\n",
      "coherence in the efforts to implement them further.\n",
      "Otherwise, the proliferation of initiatives threatens to create\n",
      "more problems than solutions.\n",
      "Secondly, I wish to propose that the working group\n",
      "seek new ways of creating effective partnerships to reduce\n",

      "members to lend their support to the initiative launched last\n",

      "of that coalition in their own efforts to make a difference\n",
      "in the fight against AIDS.\n",
      "Thirdly, I wish to propose that the working group\n",

      "That is why I have proposed a master plan, in\n",

      "three basic objectives and steps to realize them.\n",
      "What was agreed at Sharm el-Sheikh can be\n",
      "summarized as follows. First, both sides agreed to issue\n",
      "public statements unequivocally calling for an end of\n",
      "violence. They also agreed to take immediate, concrete\n",
      "measures to end the current confrontation, eliminate\n",
      "points of friction, ensure an end to violence and\n",
      "incitement, maintain calm, and prevent a recurrence of\n",
      "recent events. It was agreed that, to accomplish this,\n",
      "both sides would act immediately to return the situation\n",
      "to that which existed prior to the current crisis, in areas\n",
      "such as restoring law and order, redeployment of\n",
      "forces, eliminating points of friction, enhancing\n",
      "security cooperation and ending the closure of and\n",
      "reopening, the Gaza airport. The United States\n",
      "undertook to facilitate security cooperation between the\n",
      "parties.\n",
      "Secondly, it was agreed that the United States\n",
      "would develop with the Israelis and Palestinians, as\n",
      "well as in consultation with the United Nations\n",
      "Secretary-General, a committee to undertake fact-\n",
      "finding on the events of the past several weeks and to\n",
      "seek ways to prevent their recurrence. The committee’s\n",
      "report will be shared by the United States President\n",
      "with the Secretary-General and the parties prior to\n",
      "publication. A final report will be submitted under the\n",
      "auspices of the United States President for publication.\n",
      "Thirdly, it was agreed that, if we are to address\n",
      "the underlying roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\n",
      "there must be a pathway back to negotiations and a\n",
      "resumption of efforts to reach a permanent status\n",
      "agreement based on Security Council resolutions 242\n",
      "(1967) and 338 (1973) and subsequent understandings.\n",

      "In my view, the agreements reached in Sharm el-\n",
      "Sheikh are a vital first step back from the brink and\n",
      "towards a resumption of the peace process. It is\n",
      "essential that they should be faithfully implemented in\n",
      "their entirety by both sides. They may contain elements\n",
      "to which one side attaches more importance than does\n",
      "the other. But both parties need to demonstrate good\n",
      "faith — above all by their actions. It is not going to be\n",
      "easy. Mutual mistrust is deep. There are wounds in the\n",
      "families and communities concerned that may take a\n",
      "generation to heal. But we must move forward, painful\n",
      "though it is, so that the children and youth of today —\n",
      "angry and frustrated as they are — can have a better\n",
      "world to live in.\n",

      "there can be no lasting security without lasting peace.\n",
      "That is why we need to look beyond the violence and\n",
      "bitterness, the pain and the hurt, to a future in which\n",
      "Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in a just\n",
      "and lasting peace.\n",
      "This leads me, if I may, to end by addressing a\n",
      "few words to the wider international community, and to\n",
      "you, the Ambassadors of the Member States. It is only\n",
      "natural that the events of the past few weeks should\n",
      "arouse strong feelings. I myself have strong feelings\n",
      "about those events. I believe deeply that every life lost\n",
      "is a human tragedy, and that all human life is of equal\n",
      "value. My thoughts and prayers are with the families\n",
      "and communities on both sides that have endured such\n",
      "pain and suffering. I want to see the violence ended and\n",

      "the region at such short notice and with such uncertain\n",
      "prospects of success.\n",
      "But I also believe that the General Assembly can\n",
      "make a real difference. We are not yet certain whether\n",
      "or not normalcy will be restored. We can only wait and hope. The next few days are vital. Meanwhile, we\n",
      "should remember that, as I said in Sharm el-Sheikh,\n",
      "words can inflame or soothe, and everyone needs a\n",
      "restoration of calm and quiet so as to create the best\n",

      "refuse to respect common principles of human dignity.\n",
      "It is hard to imagine how the tragedy of 11\n",
      "September could have been worse. Yet the truth is that\n",
      "a single attack involving a nuclear or biological\n",
      "weapon could have killed millions. While the world\n",
      "was unable to prevent the 11 September attacks, there\n",
      "is much we can do to help prevent future terrorist acts\n",
